# Data-structures-and-algorithms
My 'Data structures and algorithms' learning codes. I study independently through various online sources. When a subject is discussed I usually create a code implementing it for a better understanding. These are the implementations of the subjects I have learned so far.

One of my sources was the Udemy course: The Complete Data Structures and Algorithms Course in Python by Elshad Karimov. Thus, some of the functions are based on classes obtained from the course.
Additionally, some files are solutions to exercises from the above course.
